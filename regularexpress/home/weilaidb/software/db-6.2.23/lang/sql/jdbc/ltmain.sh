# func_to_host_path arg

# Convert paths to host format when used with build tools.
# Intended for use with "native" mingw (where libtool itself
# is running under the msys shell), or in the following cross-
# build environments:
#    $build          $host
#    mingw (msys)    mingw  [e.g. native]
#    cygwin          mingw
#    *nix + wine     mingw
# where wine is equipped with the `winepath' executable.
# In the native mingw case, the (msys) shell automatically
# converts paths for any non-msys applications it launches,
# but that facility isn't available from inside the cwrapper.
# Similar accommodations are necessary for $host mingw and
# $build cygwin.  Calling this function does no harm for other
# $host/$build combinations not listed above.
#
# ARG is the path (on $build) that should be converted to
# the proper representation for $host. The result is stored
# in $func_to_host_path_result.

# following $build/$host combinations (but does no harm for
# combinations not listed here):
#    $build          $host
#    mingw (msys)    mingw  [e.g. native]
#    cygwin          mingw
#    *nix + wine     mingw
#
# Path separators are also converted from $build format to
# $host format. If ARG begins or ends with a path separator
# character, it is preserved (but converted to $host format)
# on output.
#
# ARG is a pathlist (on $build) that should be converted to
# the proper representation on $host. The result is stored

# The TAGs below are defined such that we never get into a situation
# in which we disable both kinds of libraries.  Given conflicting
# choices, we go for a static library, that is the most portable,
# since we can't tell whether shared libraries were disabled because
# the user asked for that or because the platform doesn't support
# them.  This is particularly important on AIX, because we don't
# support having both static and shared libraries enabled at the same
# time on that platform, so we default to a shared-only configuration.
# If a disable-shared tag is given, we'll fallback to a static-only
# configuration.  But we'll never go from static-only to shared-only.
